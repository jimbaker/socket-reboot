Implementing the socket, select, and ssl module is non-trivial for
Jython, given the difference between the APIs and the underlying Java
platform. This is especially the case nonblocking support.

This draft design doc demonstrates that we can use Netty 4 to
implement the necessary semantics - with just a small number of
exceptions - of these standard networking modules.

In addition, the necessary jars we would need to add to Jython are
minimal in size, on the order of 1 MB (no need for codes, or most of
the transports).


Import semantics
================

For now, we will assume that this new work is written in Python, using
Java (aka, pure Jython). Because of the use of Jar Jar Links, use of
the io.netty namespace may be in org.python.io.netty; we simply do the
following in an underlying _socket support module to pull in the Netty
namespace:

````python
try:
    import org.python.io.netty as netty
except ImportError:
    import io.netty as netty
````

Netty uses a `ThreadPoolGroup` to manage channels (including SSLEngine
tasks) and the corresponding event loop. Each group is connected with
the Bootstrap factory, which manages socket options. So _socket will
also instantiate a common `NioThreadPoolGroup` (possibly both worker
and boss) for all subsequent operations.
 
_socket should use atexit.register to register a shutdown hook that
does `group.shutdown()`; note this is a deprecated method, but
`shutdownGracefully()` takes too long. In general, we should expect
code that is using sockets has done some sort of graceful shutdown at
the app level and any produced errors will demonstrate where this code
has not in fact done so. Given that the thread pool is composed of
daemon threads, this is likely not an issue regardless.

Note that Bootstrap/ServerBootstrap, SSLEngine, and other resources
are fairly lightweight, so they can be simply constructed as needed.

In certain cases, imports of _socket and usage of Python sockets may
fail due to security manager restrictions:

* Thread FIXME
* Socket FIXME

My understanding is that restricting creation of threads is fairly
rare in containers, and would presumably be subsumed under socket
construction.

`socket._socketobject`
======================

Wraps channels and all necessary operations. FIXME


Unification of blocking/nonblocking socket support
==================================================

It seems to be a fairly common pattern for Python code to switch from
blocking to nonblocking support, generally to avoid such issues as
managing SSL handshaking asynchronously. (I'm not aware of code going
the opposite direction.)

The current implementation requires multiple implementations, and
switching from blocking to nonblocking introduces a variety of
limitations: no true zero blocking, issues with select, not to mention
lack of SSL.

So unification will be a big win.

To implement, we will use Netty's inherent support of asynchrony for
nonblocking support, then layer blocking support on as follows:

* Many operations in Netty return a `ChannelFuture`; to block, simply
  use `future.sync()`. A state variable in the Python socket wrapper
  can dictate.

* Other operations, notably read, use a `ChannelHandler`. This handler
  can simply notify a condition variable in the corresponding Python
  socket wrapper. (We do need to ensure that there is no race
  condition if a read is in progress, and the socket is switched from
  nonblocking to blocking, although this seems like a pathological
  case regardless.)


Late binding of `socket.bind`
=============================

Per these docs FIXME, the same restriction will apply for ephemeral
sockets as in current Jython - bind is intent, not final. This is a
fundamental limitation of Java's design.


Implementing `socket.send`, `socket.sendall`
============================================

`socket.send` needs to take into account isWritable; `socket.sendall`
simply blocks accordingly (I don't believe this makes any sense for
nonblocking sockets TBD).


`socket.recv`
=============

Read handler, notify any blocking reads; make data available to the socket.


Implementing `socket.accept`
============================

Netty's ServerSocketChannel objects use a [child handler][] to setup
newly created child sockets. This child handler can readily put on a
blocking queue for such newly created child sockets (per Python socket
wrapper):

````python
class ChildInitializer(ChannelInitializer):

    def __init__(self, parent_wrapper):
        self.parent_wrapper = parent_wrapper 

    def initChannel(self, ch):
	# ensure channel is setup per parent
	if self.parent_wrapper.ssl_wrapped:
	    pipeline = ch.pipeline()
	    engine = SSLContext.getDefault().createSSLEngine()
            engine.setUseClientMode(False);
            pipeline.addLast("ssl", SslHandler(engine)

    	child_sock = self.parent_wrapper.create_child_socket(ch)
	# above ensures calling something like:
	# self.parent_wrapper.new_children.put(child_sock)

	# also publish event for select.select/select.poll for
        # interested listeners (if any)

````

`socket.accept` simply looks like the following:

````python
class _socketobject(object):
    ...

    def accept(self):
        if self.nonblocking:
            child_sock = self.new_children.poll(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        else:
            child_sock = self.new_children.take()
        return child_sock, child_sock.address
````

Some notes:

* `poll` (fortunately) is nonblocking for a timeout of zero, instead of
  blocking infinitely.

* Not certain if we can use the backlog in `socket.listen` to
  determine capacity of the blocking queue - this may not be directly
  translatable to Netty.


`select.select`
===============

Need to adapt ChannelHandler events to appropriate readable, writable,
exception lists in `select.select`:

* Ready for reading by collecting `channelRead`
* Ready for writing can detect by triggering on:

     1. `channelWritabilityChanged`
     2. and checking whether `Channel.isWritable()`

* Errors by collecting with `exceptionCaught`

Collection works as follows:

A given `select.select` registers an addFirst handler for each channel
on its pipeline (presumes the usual convention - and way to write
bug-free socket code! - that there is not a large number of selects
concurrently watching every socket, but instead this is
partitioned). addFirst ensures that select will always be triggered,
and allows for simple propagation through the pipeline for any other
handlers (such propagation is a must).

(Do we really want addFirst? It may be possible that such things as
SSL may consume the pipeline, so we may want addLast. Regardless, the
pipeline is completely controlled by the Jython implementation.)

The handler knows the corresponding select object and can write to it.

Notification is via a `ConcurrentSkipListSet` per read/write/error
(choice of this set is to keep similar natural ordering semantics to
CPython and of course support concurrent completions). Notification
also triggers a condition variable associated with the select
object. The original `select.select` wakes up, then removes all
handlers from each channel pipeline, and then returns to the calling
function, listifying the sets. (Does the original order of file
descriptors have to be maintained?)

http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter.html#channelRead(io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext, java.lang.Object)

 http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter.html#channelWritabilityChanged(io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext)

http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter.html#exceptionCaught(io.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext, java.lang.Throwable)


`select.poll`
=============

Construct a `poll` object as usual with `select.poll()`; then

* `poll.register` - use the same events (channelRead,
  channelWritabilityChanged, exceptionCaught) as `select.select`, but
  add handlers that enqueue such events to a LinkedBlockingQueue for
  the `poll` object. It's not clear if we need to combine events
  together for the same file descriptor - probably not.

* `poll.unregister` - check for `NoSuchElementException` when using
  `pipeline.remove(handler)`, convert to Python's `KeyError`

* `poll.poll` - poll the blocking queue with an appropriate timeout,
  include zero (default).


`ssl.unwrap`
============

* SslHandler can be added/removed from the ChannelPipeline at any
  time, so this allows support for ssl.wrap/ssl.unwrap

* The wrapping SSLSocket can simply note this state change, including
  ensuring child sockets have the appropriate SSL behavior.


Differences in socket framing
=============================

SSLSocket.do_handshake()

Per the docs (http://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html#ssl.SSLSocket.do_handshake)

> Perform a TLS/SSL handshake. If this is used with a non-blocking
  socket, it may raise SSLError with an arg[0] of SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ
  or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE, in which case it must be called again until
  it completes successfully.

The operative term is *may*, so we do not have to support this
behavior and just let the threadpool do it.

This is seen in the example in the docs, which simulates blocking
behavior on nonblocking SSL sockets:

````python
while True:
    try:
        s.do_handshake()
        break
    except ssl.SSLError as err:
        if err.args[0] == ssl.SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ:
            select.select([s], [], [])
        elif err.args[0] == ssl.SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE:
            select.select([], [s], [])
        else:
            raise
````

Such code will never see `ssl.SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ` and
`ssl.SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE` exceptions, but will continue to be
correct.


UDP/datagram support
====================

FIXME - available in Netty 4 - apparently this is one advantage over
Async*Channel. Apparently async datagram channel support slipped to
Java 8.


Exceptions
==========

The socket module currently provides a comprehensive mapping of Java
exceptions to Python versions. This needs to be revisited.


Other functionality
===================

The socket, ssl, and select modules provide other functionality;
however, much of this is already complete and can be copied over from
the existing implementation or my [experimental branch][] (eg peer
certificate introspection).


Still to be resolved
====================

* Jython currently does not support selectable files. However, Netty
  (and the underlying Java platform, I believe this may require NIO2,
  which is part of Java 7), now does support completions on
  files. However, this would require revisiting our own implementation
  of Python New IO. Lastly, JRuby now supports [selectable stdin][],
  but presumably this requires bolting in a suitable stdin plugin for
  this functionality into Netty.

* Supporting raw sockets. Presumably this could be done with something
  like RockSaw (http://www.savarese.com/software/rocksaw/, Apache
  licensed), but does not appear to be immediately pluggable into
  Netty.

* I do not think this applies: 

     * http://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#socket.socket.settimeout vs
     * http://netty.io/4.0/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelFuture.html 
       "Do not confuse I/O timeout and await timeout"


Effiency considerations
=======================

Given how Netty pipelines and that all operations are done with
respect to ByteBuf, it's likely that there would be little benefit in
translating to Java, except for perhaps a couple of hot spots.

Copying between ByteBuf and PyString introduces unfortunate overhead
and extra allocation costs. `socket.recv_into` probably doesn't help,
given the differences between the buffer API and ByteBuf.
